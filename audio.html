            <h2>Bacon</h2>
            <p>
                Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically from the pork belly or from the less fatty back cuts. It is eaten on
                its own, as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes (e.g., the club sandwich). Bacon is
                also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, The word is derived from the Old High German Bahho, meaning "buttock"
                "ham" or "side of bacon", and is cognate with the Old French bacon. It may also be distantly cognate with modern German Bauch,
                meaning "abdomen, belly". <a href="https://www.verymeaty.com/processed-meat/bacon/does-bacon-salt-have-bacon-in-it/">more text...</a>

            <h2>Egg</h2>
            <p>
                Both the white and yolk of an egg are rich in nutrients, including proteins, vitamins and minerals. The yolk also contains cholesterol,
                fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins D and E) and essential fatty acids. Eggs are also an important and versatile ingredient for
                cooking, as their particular chemical make-up is literally the glue of many important baking reactions. Since the domestication of the
                chicken, people have been enjoying and nourishing themselves with eggs. As a long time symbol of fertility and rebirth, the egg has
                taken its place in religious as well as culinary history. Ipes of egg available, the most commonly raised are chicken eggs while more
                gourmet choices include duck, goose and quail eggs. <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-eggs">more text...</a>
